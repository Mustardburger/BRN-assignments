# BRN assignments - Phuc Nguyen

My name is Phuc Nguyen, and I am a fourth-year Biomedical Engineering student at the University of Cincinnati. I am interested in applying for the project **Spatial Proteomics of the Spleen** by Dr. Kuan-Lin Huang. This Github repo contains the 3 assignments required for joining the project: `tic-tac-toe_python` for the Python Programming, `Python_for_Data_Science` for Python for Data Science, and `Single-cell_RNA-seq` for`Single-Cell RNA-Seq assignments.

Thank you!
