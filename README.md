# BRN assignments - Phuc Nguyen

My name is Phuc Nguyen, and I am a fourth-year Biomedical Engineering student at the University of Cincinnati. I am interested in applying for the project ***Spatial Proteomics of the Spleen*** by Dr. Kuan-Lin Huang. This Github repo contains the 3 assignments required for joining the project: `tic-tac-toe_python` for the Python Programming, `Python_for_Data_Science` for Python for Data Science, and `Single-cell_RNA-seq` for`Single-Cell RNA-Seq assignments.

For `tic-tac-toe_python`, the only external library required to run the program is `numpy`, and the version used was included in `requirements.txt`. To run the program, please first run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in a `virtualenv`. Then `cd` into the folder and `python play.py` without any additional arguments.

Thank you!
